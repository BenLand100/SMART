SMART was created by BenLand100 a very long time ago. It is currently hosted
on github at https://github.com/BenLand100/SMART and is mostly used by the
SRL community at http://villavu.com/ where it is a key component in their 
attempts to cheat at RuneScape. SMART is released under the GPLv3 and at this
time generally gets about 10,000 uses each month. For questions, suggestions,
comments, etc., try one of the two links given earlier.

To Build SMART, use the instructions given in the Makefile by running `make`
in the root directory (the directory this file is in). Currently SMART has 
build targets for Linux and Windows and is mostly architecture independent, 
minus problems with Windows x64 which are most likely the result of being 
used improperly. For historical reasons, the longest lasting program to 
ever be used in RuneScape cheating, SCAR, has its own target option, which 
is basically the same as Windows. Newer programs such as Simba and other
lanuage bindings should use the generic platform targets.

SMART comes with some examples of use and various language bindings in the
test-apps folder, use `make test` in the root folder to build them into 
the dist directory where they can be run properly.

The reflection subdirectory contains an old Runescape updater for refrence
purposes, see the README file in there for more info.
