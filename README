SMART was created by BenLand100 a very long time ago. It is currently hosted
on github at https://github.com/BenLand100/SMART and is mostly used by the
SRL community at http://villavu.com/ where it is a key component in their 
attempts to cheat at RuneScape. SMART is released under the GPLv3 and at this
time generally gets about 40,000 uses each day. For questions, suggestions,
comments, etc., try one of the two links given earlier.

To Build SMART, use the instructions given in the Makefile by running `make`
in the root directory (the directory this file is in). Currently SMART has 
build targets for Linux and Windows and is mostly architecture independent.

SMART was recently (v7.1) moved out of the process of the controller and 
implements a shared memory / socket IPC framework. In v8.0 SMART was overhauled
to remove most native requirements and become more java-centric.

SMART comes with some examples of use and various language bindings in the
test-apps folder, use `make test` in the root folder to build them into 
the dist directory where they can be run properly.
