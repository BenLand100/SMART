This folder contains an older and slightly outdated implementation of an 
updater. It will not work well for new runescape clients, but it will
function as a nice base to build off of by showing the basics of what is 
required. It is kept for historical reasons, do not report bugs related to
its function. Use the makefile to build a distribution.

tl;dr --- This does not work, it's only an example
